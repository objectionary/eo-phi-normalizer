# @todo #2736:30min Enable the test when it's possible. Such syntax is invalid - we can't use
#  horizontal method after vertical method. If we decide that we allow such syntax we should add
#  "vmethod" to "hmethodHeadExtended" rule and resolve left recursion violation. Don't forget
#  to remove the puzzle
